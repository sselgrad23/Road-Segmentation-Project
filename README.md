# Road-Segmentation-Project
We compare and contrast the recently published Y-Net architecture, a model for segmentation using a large and a small arm, with a standard U-Net and demonstrate that unlike claimed by the Y-Net’s authors there is no apparent advantage to Y-Net by providing a detailed ablation on the number of arms used. Furthermore, we propose so-called Large Upsampling (LU) which improves Y-Net’s performance in image segmentation. Lastly, we provide a first open implementation of the Y-Net architecture, as well as our improvements and proposed changes.
